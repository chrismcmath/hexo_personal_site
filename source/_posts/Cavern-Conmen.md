DoX (Tahir Vico), Nipiton (Wongsuparatkul) and I met at Global Game Jam Bangkok and spent a good amount of time discussing what we wanted to make before settling into grunt mode. Working surrounded by tens of teams all beavering away was pretty motivating, and seeing the projects during the presentations was enticing and humbling to say the least. Great ideas and technical feats were in abundance.

Through our design iterations we managed to settle on a social game that other people could drop in and out of. The game uses linguistic communication between players as its core mechanic, and the local network to sync the game state between devices. Players cannot see what is around them, rather they must trust what their opponent tells them. The effect was something like the popular party game Mafia/Werewolf, with relationships mutating over individual games. 

The biggest issue with the game was how it communicated its own mechanics- one of the pictures above shows me stuggling to explain the concept to the judges. As a party game it should be instantly grok-able, but unfortunatley we ran out of time before figuring out how to achieve this.
