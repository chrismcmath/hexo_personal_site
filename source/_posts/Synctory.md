tagline: Tool for scripting multi-threaded narratives
---

VR is ushering in a new era of storytelling, and the avenue of most interest to me is something I've termed 'multi-threaded narrative'; simply multiple stories happening simulanteously that the player curates.

Synchronising multiple interweaving storylines is incredibly difficult, and Synctory is designed to take some of the pain out of it.
