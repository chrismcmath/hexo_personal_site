tagline: Tool for scripting multi-threaded narratives
---

Synctory is a script-writing tool designed to make writing multi-threaded narratives as painless as possible.

Multi-threaded narratives require the viewer to have some choice in which things they observe. Things are happening simultaneously; to watch one storyline is to miss out on the other. This allows the artist great opportunities to play with perspective, pacing and social dimensions.

Synctory's output is something that looks very much like a screenplay. This can be used for the creation of immersive plays, interactive films or narrative-based video games. It can also be imported into the Unity game engine via the <a href="2015/10/02/Synctory-Unity-Library/">Unity Synctory Library<a>.
