Submission for LD33 (theme 'You Are the Monster') and made in under 48 hours.

Certainly the product of 'biting off more than I could chew', the project nevertheless allowed me my first ditherings with procedural generation, and while the core game loop was under-designed I had great fun working on the game feel via animations, sound and tweenings.

A full post-mortem on this game can be found here.
