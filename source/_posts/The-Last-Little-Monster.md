My submission for LD33, the theme was 'You Are the Monster'.

Certainly the product of 'biting off more than I could chew', the project nevertheless allowed me my first ditherings with procedural generation, and while the core game loop was under-designed I had great fun working on the game feel via animations, sound and tweenings.
