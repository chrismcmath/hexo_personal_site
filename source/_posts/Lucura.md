My final project at Imperial, Lucura was an experiment in revolutionising the way games in education could work. It used crowd-sourcing to create content, and split the curation between teachers and students to incentivise educational and fun games.

Each game was constructed as a series of micro-games, invigorating a quiz format that could also test aptitude. The limitations this design engendered allows the game making tools to be greatly simplified.
