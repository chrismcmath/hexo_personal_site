The product of a self-organised, farewell-Beijing jam for Sam Green, Tobias Baumann, Dan Arnold-Mist and myself, the game takes mechanics from Beepee, applies a local-multiplayer mindset, dresses it in the grotesque and puts a bold pun on top.

Although the project itself was abandoned due to the practicalities of global separation, much of the technical work informed patterns in the Ent2D framework, and flying mechanic is something I'll want to use in the near future.
