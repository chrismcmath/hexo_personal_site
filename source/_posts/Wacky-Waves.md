Our brainstorming around the Waves theme brought up [this old Guinness advert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLAvkbFugEI), the most awesome representation of the power of the ocean any of us had seen. How cool would it be to play as this wave?

We drew on the stunt-arcade gameplay of skating games to define the bay as a playground in which you can reach havok, and used the progression system of Katamari Damacy by incorporating things you've swept up into the wave itself.

My favouite part of this game was allowing the player to embody something far more abstract than usual. You are literally a force of nature.
