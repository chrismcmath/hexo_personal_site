tagline: Small JS Library to flatten meshes
---

A small javascript library built on top of THREE.js to flatten any mesh into a 2D plane. This was a core component of the <a href="2012/11/14/Chair-Builder/">Kammy Chair Builder webapp</a>, open-sourced as I thought it might be of some use to others.
