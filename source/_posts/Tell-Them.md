tagline: Two player branching narrative
---

A one day jam for LD34, the concept was around a branching narrative game (something I would usually avoid) played by two players, each taking turns to choose the next branch. 'Truth' acts as a counterpoint mechanic to this, as the choice made will necessarily be the truth or a lie. This leads to a definitive characterisation that is nevertheless mutable by the amount to which they lie, much like we in our ordinary lives are the same person day to day but may behave differently due to context.

The Synctory tool was modded and put to use here as a simple narrative branching writing application, although with networking, design and actual writing I couldn't finish it in the day.
