Working with Plug-In Media in Brighton, I was brought on at the end of the project's life-cycle, dealing with bug fixes, additional feature requests and general feedback from the client.

The app was interesting in that it was controlled via a Bluetooth static bicycle, with pedals to control momentum and handle-bars for direction.
