I'd been wanting to work with my very talented friend [Simon](http://twitter.com/pilchardgames) for a while, and LD43 was just the opportunity.

Based on an exploit from Super Mario World, we built a platformer in which the player organically switches control of their avatar via a stacking mechanic. The game allowed us to explore some fun visual ideas and experiement with level design.
