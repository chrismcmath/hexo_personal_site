A collaboration with Mika Karkinen for Pi Jam 2014.
I met Mika at Global Game Jam Bangkok 2015 where his team <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/piglet-panic">swooped both the audience and critics prizes</a>. Mika has the ability to invoke a sense of fun without ever overloading an art style with complexity; he's also incredibly fast and an incredibly affable guy! 

We spent a while thinking about the theme of the game- should it be abstract (we considered having the pi symbol as the player's avatar) or based somehow on the history of the concept? We ended up choosing the later and setting it in a Pi-ramid (drum sting please). It added a certain sense of mystery and wonder which the number certainly deserves!

I was quite proud of how we managed to use Pi as the core mechanic of the game, and build physics based puzzles on top of it. As a short five minute experience it certainly doesn't lag, although I'd be curious to see how much further the concepts could be taken, seeing as we'd reached a limit by deadline.
