A collaboration with Mika Karkinen for Pi Jam 2014.
I met Mika at Global Game Jam Bangkok 2015, where his team swooped both the audience and critics prizes (inc. link). Mika has the ability to invoke a sense of fun without ever overloading an art style with complexity; he's also incredibly fast and an incredibly affable guy! 

We spend a while thinking about the theme of the game- should it be abstract (for a while we thought about having the symbol as the player's avatar) or based somehow on the history of the concept? We ended up choosing the later and setting it in a Pi-ramid (drum crash please). It added a certain sense of mystery and wonder which the number certainly deserves!

I was quite proud of how we managed to use Pi as the core mechanic of the game, and build physics based puzzles on top of it. As a short five minute experience it certainly doesn't lag, although I'd be curious to see how much further the concepts could be taken, seeing as we'd reached a limit by the end of our designs.
