tagline: Webapp for building 3D chairs from 2D sheets of material
---

A collaborative experiment with <a href="http://www.peoples-products.com/pido/">People's Industrial Design Office</a>, the app allowed users to design their own chair by editing the shape of a 2D plane, which is then folded origami-style into a chair. The technical challenges of the project were significant, but as we wanted to roadtest it at the Get It Louder exhibition we took shortcuts, using polygonal meshes (rather than meshes) and approximating the folding of the mesh from 2D to 3D.
