I joined Arena Gods at first to help refactor the code to be network-ready. This soon became a large task that involved rewriting many features and implementing news ones.

We were a small but dispersed team spread across three different continents, but managed to use modern work paradigms to keep co-ordinated and prevent project blocks.
