Old Timers, the culmination of the mini3T experiments, was a labour of love that I regrettably decided to shelve in June of 2019.

Over the project I split myself between development, design and even marketing, and learnt a lot more about making games and our industry in the process. 

I imagine I will return to these ideas, and perhaps even the tech I built, at some point in the future, but for now my trip down the time-travel rabbit hole is on hiatus.

A full post-mortem is forthcoming...
