<a href="2014/10/01/Synctory/">Synctory</a> is a great tool for writing scripts for theatre, but its real power is in the potential it was for integration with other systems. The Synctory Library for Unity is the next part in a system to streamline the production of multi-threaded narrative experiences.

The library currently features the ability to import scripts, to view those scripts in a real-time script viewer, and a binding system that allows various elements to react to changes in the script over time.
