---

mini3T is the codename for a series of prototypes built exploring different methods of depiciting time-travel in a video game. The project came out of a conversation a couple of years ago about the film Looper. Hollywood movies can 'fudge' their time-travel quite easily, whereas games are usually stuck with time-manipulation (marginalising actual time-travel to a theme or plot device). This project is an attempt to make a time-travel game where you actually feel like a time traveller.

From these prototypes came the split-screen time-travel idea of Old Timers.
